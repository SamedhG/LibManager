# LibManager

- Project to learn PHP & MySQL
- A database to represent books and members to a library
- Frontend allows to edit the database without understanding the structure of the background data

  ### Future considerations

  - usernames and passwords on php/sqlvar.php & index.php must not be in plaintext
  - Several improvements on this project will be required for security reasons
  - The software might be vulnerable to XSS and SQL injection attacks
  - Further UI upgrades might be done with JS as I learn more frameworks in this domain
